# ghost-docker
GHOST is the world's most popular modern open source blogging and publishing platform. Ghost is designed in such a way that it simplifies the process of online publishing for individual bloggers as well as online publications.
In this project , i have deployed the ghost architecture inside a docker container and linked it with mysql as a database.
Docker-compose is used to run multiple containers as a single service.
Docker-Compose allows the containers to be launched within few seconds with a single command.
